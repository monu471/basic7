    "Raw strings, denoted by the prefix \"r\" before the string literal, are often used in Regex objects to avoid unwanted interpretation or escaping of special characters. In regular expressions, there are several special characters such as backslashes (\\), which have special meanings and are used to define regex patterns.\n",

This is useful because regular expressions often contain many backslashes and special characters, and using raw strings makes it easier to write and read regex patterns without the need for excessive escaping."
